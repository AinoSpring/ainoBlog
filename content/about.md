## About me

I am Aino! You probably never heard this name but yes, it's my real name.
I am a german software developer. I just write some stuff for fun in my free time.
I mostly do back-end stuff and currently try some machine-learning and I **love** linux!

As you can see, this site was created using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a 3rd-party [theme](https://github.com/LordMathis/hugo-theme-nightfall),
so I really hate front-end.

If you have some interesting projects, make sure to contact me. I would really appreciate to participate.

## About this site

Here I just post some projects I've done. The major reason I created this site is because
I want to document my projects and because I don't know what to code at the time of writing this.
